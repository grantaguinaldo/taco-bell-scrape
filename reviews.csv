3.0 star rating,"I love Taco Bell and I'm not afraid to say it! I understand that's sacrilege for a self-proclaimed foodie like myself. But who doesn't love fa $5 value box...or maybe 3 quesedillas (extra cheese)...or 5 Dotiros Locos tacos after a big evening (or my case morning)? So as a disclaimer, this Taco Bell gets its stars by the merits of the food alone.My gripes with this Taco Bell are twofold: 1) It's not open late ------ whah?! This Yelp page says it closes at midnight but I've rolled up past 10pm several times have been shooed away from the drive-through and the front door.2) It takes forever to get food when you order inside. So much for fast, right?",3.0
3.0 star rating,"Simple and SweetPros: Alright lets be real, its fast food so it can only be so good right? I think its the best fast food around the area (given that there is only togos and taco hell). Its located right next to USC so it helps students who are on a tight schedule (or budget) get fed quickly. I personally say the best items on the menu are the quesaritos and the AM crunchwraps. The interior is ehh but the cool part is that they have USC Trojans engraved into their wall so that's pretty cool!  Don't forget its budget friendly!  Cons: Its fast food. Don't go in there expecting healthy, you can throw that all out the window.The neighborhood is sorta ghetto but ehh it builds character.",3.0
5.0 star rating,"I've been to over 20 Taco Bell's in my life.. Taco Bell is my shit. (No pun intended) and this place makes the fattest tacos, burritos, gorditas, whatever it may be. I appreciate how consistently they hook me up.",5.0
1.0 star rating,Judgmental rude workers. Worst Taco Bell in Los Angeles hands down. Don't ever come in here. Never.,1.0
1.0 star rating,Update the hours!!! This place closes at 11. Or atleast turn the drive-thru open sign off. Smh not just a tiny crumbled piece of paper in the corner saying you close at 11. So unprofessional.,1.0
5.0 star rating,"Always clean and gets my order out correct and quickly, but what compelled me to write this review was that there was a guy sitting at a table, looking very sad and obviously unable to afford a meal, even at taco bell. An employee came over and asked if he was hungry and got him food. It was a thoughtful and respectable choice that no one questioned.",5.0
1.0 star rating,Filthy floors tables bathroom drink area. Gross!!! Don't you think it's just as dirty in the back where they are preparing our food. Really bad. One thing I do like is they use gloves to prepare food!!,1.0
2.0 star rating,"Manager served me at window. No real greeting, was confused about separate order, and seemed frustrated. I come from an extensive customer service background working for both In-N-Out Burger, Chick-fil-A and Raising Canes where it's a pleasure to serve the guests that ultimately pay our checks. Disappointed in the service here.",2.0
1.0 star rating,"Their signs say they close at midnight. However, I've came to this Taco Bell for multiple times just after 11pm and they are always closed. They need to update their hours. I would understand if the doors would be closed but at least keep the drive through open.",1.0
3.0 star rating,"This Taco Bell, located across the street from the western entrance of USC, is a usual students on their way to and from class.Selection is similar to any other Taco Bell.  The one thing that always annoyed me about this spot is that their sauces aren't out for you to help yourself. First world problems....I try to avoid this spot because it's bad for my girlish figure, but it's nice to indulge every now and then.My faves: 7-layer burrito, XXL Grilled Stuft Burrito (Chicken), Cheesy Gordita Crunch, Volcano Burrito/TacoNow I'm hungry....",3.0
1.0 star rating,"Had to ask for an item missing from the order.The floors were so sticky I could feel my boots peel off with every step.After asking one of the employees if they had a First Aid Kit, I got a blank stare like I had asked a 5 year old how to solve a calculus problem.",1.0
1.0 star rating,"ALERT:: FOOD POISONING!!!!My girlfriend & I had an excellent day planned, visit the Natural History Museum, & then enjoy some live music at the African American Museum. Didn't happen! Went to this forsaken place, had a chicken quesadilla meal and literally right after I stepped out of the store, I fell INCREDIBLY ill. My stomach was upset for hours, I threw up a few times and we essentially had our day ruined. Seeing that this is a Taco Bell, and one with awful reviews, I probably should have been more cautious in my selection but, if you are able to go ANYWHERE ELSE, I advise that you do. This is a university town so there are plenty of options. The anguish isn't worth it despite how enticing the menu might look. Look elsewhere, you might just be preventing yourself from what I could honesty call the worst food positioning I have ever experienced.",1.0
1.0 star rating,"Who in the world checks Yelp for Taco Bell? Well my review for KFC on Fig received a useful vote, so I suppose some people make very informed decisions, even with fast food.So yeah this is Taco Bell. It offers your typical Americanized ""Mexican"" ""food"" that you expect from a Taco Bell. Yep, Taco Bell where the beef isn't beef and the cheese isn't cheese (Yep, real cheese will grow mold quickly. This cheese is actually similar to cardboard - funny process, you should check it out sometime). So with these disadvantages that come with being part of a national chain, does this Taco Bell deliver exceptional service? Not at all. One time I was sitting here, doing work during a non-busy hour. An employee shuts off the drink machine before my third refill. Another time, I was getting my drink for the first time. I had to dump out a cup full of Mountain Dew Baja Blast because the syrup needed to be changed. Before I could pick a different drink, the employee behind the counter shuts off the machine. Does the smart guy who runs this place realize that fountain drinks cost a few cents to fill? Does he realize that being total assholes to your customers is never a sound business strategy?This made me wonder what the hell am I doing at Taco Bell - and I can't really answer. Avoid this and any other Taco Bells - your body will thank you for it. If you absolutely need to eat out and you live west of USC, Togo's is the better choice.",1.0
5.0 star rating,"I visited this Taco Bell for breakfast several days ago. I was super amazed by a young man who took my order -  in an extremely polite, friendly and professional way.  All that sudden, I though I was in Bottega Louie!  I order grilled soft taco and some other stuff for my friends. It's good...no surprise ...good for a peaceful breakfast.  I got my food to go.",5.0
1.0 star rating,Worst fast food restaurant i have been to so far. I went in today with my husband after having fun at the museum. The customer service was okay it was just the amount of solicitors that came in to the restaurant didnt even get a chance to take a bite from my food when one after another approched to my table some were asking for money others were asking for my food. I gave a taco to a lady who sat right next to me staring and asking for food but it  Killed My Appetite when two other men  started to approch my table as well smelled so bad. Its so ghetto and loud many people just walk in and out mainly homeless . Even after leaving the restaurant the same people where standing right outside and asking for more money and my left over food which i did not even end up eating!,1.0
2.0 star rating,"Dano's Quick Review:pro:1- They make the food like it is ordered (most of the time)2- The workers have a passable work ethic to do their jobs for the most parts3- Mountain Dew Baja Blast Slushy...Perfect Beverage, for the summer.Cons;1- Slow during rush hours , but to be expect, but if somehow you could defeat this aspect of your day to day activities , you guys would be ripping all the Tbells in LA2- Little mistakes like no adding sour cream, or not putting fire sauce in the bag.. that can't happen. Those are the little things that keep this whole taco bell thing working3. Narrow drive through.",2.0
3.0 star rating,"Taco Bell. USC.That's pretty much it.I remember my college days, Taco Bell used to be on my food pyramid. Plus, being a college kid and refund checks go low, this and cup noodles was it.Not sure how the spoiled kids fare ... maybe they have their parents deliver steaks to their door-steps?Either way, Taco Bell... is just cheap, magical food!Get that Doritos Loco taco, you WILL NOT be disappointed!!",3.0
1.0 star rating,"Not open until 12 am as stated, when I went on a Friday night around 11 pm. Gotta go to K-town Taco Bell to satisfy ze craving!",1.0
4.0 star rating,"I'm not sure what the bad buzz's about. It's a pretty standard Taco Bell with clean tables and good customer service. The surrounding area could use some work but that's more the city's fault than the owner's. If you need to get your taco on the quick, no better place to stop.",4.0
