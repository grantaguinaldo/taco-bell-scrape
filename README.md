## Web Scraping Using Beautiful Soup, Pandas and Requests.

This repo contains the code that was developed to scrape a web site using Beautiful Soup, Pandas and Requests. 

The YouTube video that was made is [here](https://youtu.be/iqWZQcW5FTE)

***
* Webpage contains content inserted between tags (HTML tags and/or CSS)

* Tags on a webpage can be nested (i.e., one tag can contain one or more tags that contain more data)

* BeautifulSoup allows you to search for tags within HTML code and return the values back to you in the form of a list. 

* Use your knowledge of HTML and the Inspector to find the content on the page that you are interested in. 
	Think of it as going fishing or seaching for something. 

* Scripts are fragile since the structure of the page is fragile. Scripts need to be developed at the time that they are needed. 

* The scraping proccess is very analytical and requires trial-and-error to get what you need.  
	You need to test, debug on the fly. 

* It is best to store the data you get from scraping a page in a database or CSV file since you went through all of the work to scrape the page. 

* Know what you want before starting.
